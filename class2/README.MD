## Model development

### Introduction

<hr>

Recognized as the most "exciting" part of a Data Scientist's day-to-day life, the Model Development phase is commonly the shortest part of the project. At this stage, all the knowledge acquired during the Exploratory Data Analysis is used to build predictive models, as well as their training and evaluation.

### Goal

<hr>

In this step, we will build a **Binary Issue Ranking Model**. For this, we will use the _[Simple Transformers](https://simpletransformers.ai/)_ library, which provides a simplified interface for training deep learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
