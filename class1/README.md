### Goal

The purpose of this step is to gain a better understanding of the data, extracting relevant information through the
use of descriptive analysis techniques and tools. This phase includes, for example, building views
and the calculation of measures of central tendency. This information and insights can later be used in the Model Development phase.

For this task, you will need to develop and answer - using descriptive analysis techniques - **at least five** survey questions (RQs) about the data provided. Remember that doubts regarding the validity of the RQ prepared (from the business point of view) can be resolved with the client.
